# Frontend Challenge

## Overview

Create a responsive weather application that allows users to search for cities and view current weather conditions. The app should feature a search box with suggestions, a list of selected cities with current temperatures, and detailed weather information for each city. Users should be able to configure the temperature unit system (Kelvin, Fahrenheit, Celsius).

# Design Guideline

This is just a guideline. You can adjust or totally redesign it as you see fit.
